# Cloud Native

**Learning how to construct a CI/CD pipeline that will containerize an application and deployed it to a Kubernetes cluster.**

Notes from [Cloud Native Foundations](https://www.udacity.com/scholarships/suse-cloud-native-foundations-scholarship)

Projects include Python, Docker, Kubernetes, the CLI, Git 

# Lesson 1

## Intro to Cloud-Native



**Cloud native** a set of practices that empowers an organization to build and manage applications at scale. 

**Containers** Small units of an app. Easy to manage, deploy, and fast to recover. Fits well with a microservice-based architecture

**Microservices** are used to manage and configure a collection of small, independent services that can be easily packaged and executed within a container.

## CNCF and CN tooling

K8s - Google open-source container orchestrator with the integration of the following:
- runtime for app execution env
- ntwg for app connectivity
- storage for app resources
- service mesh for granular control of traffic w/in cluster
- logs and metrics
- tracing for building full req journey

Cloud native computing foundation (CNCF) - vendor neutral home to open-source projects such as K8s, Prometheus, and more.

## Stakeholders

Use cloud-native tooling to enable quick delivery of value to customers and easily extend to new features and tech. Main perspectives:
- business (agility - perform transformations, growth - quickly iterate based on feedback, and service avail. - 24/7)
- technical (automation, orchestration - to mng 1000s of svcs w/ minimal effort, observability - independently and debug each component)
